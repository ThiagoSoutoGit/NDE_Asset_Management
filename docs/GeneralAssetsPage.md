## Creating Assets

Creating Assets is the most basic operation on the BVQR App.

It is also a powerful tool, where you can set an Asset name, description, choose a folder to store your asset and also define permissions and Who is authorized to read, update, attach, share or delete your asset.

<br>

First click on the + Button on the Assets Page, then Create a New Asset, like the image below.

<template>
    <br>
    <v-card>
        <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Resources/Permissions/Permissions03.png">
            </center>
        <br>
    </v-card>
</template>

<br>

### New Asset window basics

First, At the New Asset Window you will fill up the Name of the asset, the description and in which folder this asset will be allocated.
You don't need to setup the permissions for the asset right now. This can be done later from the Asset Page on the "More menu".

            <center>
            <img src="./Resources/Assets/NewAsset.png">
            </center>
        <br>
    </v-card>
</template>
